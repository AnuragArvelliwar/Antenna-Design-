“A Circular Shaped Microstrip patch Antenna for Wi-Fi/UWB/X-band Applications”
##
A circular shaped Microstrip patch antenna with single band notch characteristics is designed by using relevant standards of various principles.  This Antenna is used for applications in Wi-Fi (2.4 to 5.8GHz), ultra wideband (UWB) (3.1 to 10.6 GHz) and X band (8 to 12 GHz) respectively.
##
A Software tool named CST(Computer Software Technology) is used to construct this proposed design.
Truncated ground plane, two I slots, one circular slot and two crescent shaped slots are used to improve the impedance bandwidth of the scheduled antenna.
A particular band is rejected by using one L slot into the radiation patch. L slot has different values of its parameters for the exceptional rejection
of specified WIMAX band.
##
The Size of our proposed antenna is of compact size 32mm × 36mm × 1.6mm,
which is tolerable range for distinct wireless systems. Thus, this proposed antenna is a agreeable applicant for relevant Wi-Fi, UWB and X-band operations.
